# Wegue App Dir

This directory contains your Wegue Application. It was created using the command `npm run init:app` which copied the contents from the `app-starter/` dir.

You can develop your Wegue app by modifying/adding files here, for example:

* modifying the core `.vue` files like `app/WguApp.vue` and `app/WguAppTemplate.vue`
* placing or modifying custom/app-specific components under `app/components`
* placing or modifying  static content like configuration, data, icons and css under `app/static`.

The default config file is `app/static/app-conf.json`.
